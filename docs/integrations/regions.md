# Region Integration

RMerchant features a powerful **Region Integration** system that allows the Merchant to dynamically visit player islands or territories. This creates an immersive experience where the trader travels to your players instead of staying in a fixed location.

## Supported Plugins

The plugin currently supports the following Skyblock plugins for region detection:

- **IridiumSkyblock**
- **SuperiorSkyBlock**

### Engines

RMerchant utilizes one of its 3 core engines for this feature:
- **Dynamic Visiting Engine**: The Merchant spawns at a player's island, conducts trades for a set period, and then despawns or moves to another island.

::: tip configuration
You can configure the frequency and duration of these visits in the `config.yml`.
